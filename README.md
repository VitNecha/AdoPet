# AdoPet (early name)
Android application for dog adoption in Israel. **_CURRENTLY IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT._**

Operates as a social network type application where dog shelters and relevant associations can post dogs for adoption or fosterage to the public and user that interested in adoption or fosterage can filter the posts by current location, dog size, dog age and more... 

Due to sensitive morals of the matter, private users (like single dog sellers) will not be allowed to post.

Full contact information about the source (for example, dog shelter) will be provided to the users by the app.

Posts will include picture (or pictures) and info about the dog.

**Technical info:**

> - Requires no registration (still under developer's consideration).
>
> - Developed in Java with Android Studio and Google FireBase (DB).
